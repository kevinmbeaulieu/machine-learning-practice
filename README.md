# Machine Learning practice repo

This repo contains ML models & data preprocessing utilities written as practice for understanding how they work. They mainly use Pandas to represent data, but avoid using models from scikit-learn, keras, or other similar libraries that provide prebuilt ML models.

No guarantees are made about the stability of this repo, and the code is definitely not production-ready.
